1. low possession stints are very noisy: we wanna upweight stints with more possessions
    - change IPW weights from 1/p_i to sqrt(n) / p_i
    - divide by weighted averages instead of N
    - how do we interpret this? changing the weights? changing the margin?
2. upweight all data by number of possessions
3. add identity lines to all scatterplots
4. compare RAPM (and other metrics) to 2023-2024 box score statistics
