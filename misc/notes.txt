1. note down the interpretation of the coefficients

2. compute regular PM scores
	- sum up a player's PM of every stint and take averge. make sure it's in the same units!

3. need to regularize coefficients better
	- elastic net for hyperparameter finetuning
		- try out clmnet, cv.glmnet (cross-validation)
	- good way to test coefficients (not as important):
		- run the model and store coefficients
		- choose a game
		- for each stint, predict the score margin given the players and their coefficients
		- sum up these score margins and compare to actual result

4. make a new RAPM model: indicators are whether you're on offense or defense. use this to get ORAPM and DRAPM
