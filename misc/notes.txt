1. IPW ATT, IPW-DR ATT against RAPM
    - ATT = Treated population
2. RAPM vs. Random Forest Effect (predicted given presence - predicted given absence) over treated stints
    - weighted average by n_pos
3. See IPW-DR results using different margin predictors
    - Linear, random forest, 
4. Add Random Forest to RMSE
5. Report weighted average of RMSEs instead of raw best.
